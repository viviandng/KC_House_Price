### Project Scenario
Remax Realtors is interested in better understanding home valuation of their sellers and buyers in King County, WA. They want to know the sale price that most accurately reflects the value of unlisted homes and understand how certain features affect the sale price. They're interested in providing better recommendations to their clients that take into account the KC real estate market. 

Can we effectively predict home sale price in King County (KC) for Remax realtors? Can we help Remax help their buyers/sellers better value their home based on market price trends and features in KC.

### Project Goals
